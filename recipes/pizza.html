    <h2>Amazing, Wonderful Pizza!</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 prepared pizza dough</li>
      <li>⅓ cup pizza sauce (80mL)</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (115g)</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated parmesan cheese (20g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Position an oven rack in the lower third and preheat the oven to 475F.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle.
        Transfer to a non-stick baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the pizza sauce onto the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around
        the edge. Sprinkle with cheeses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the crust is browned and the cheese
        is bubbling and beginning to brown. Let cool for a few minutes before
        cutting.
